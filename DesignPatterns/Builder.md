## Why Builder?
Allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor pollution. 
Useful when there could be several flavors of an object. Or when there are a lot of steps involved in creation of an object.

## Reason?
 there are cases when the creation logic might involve more steps. For example you want a customized Subway deal, you have several options in how your burger is made e.g what bread do you want? what types of sauces would you like? 
 What cheese would you want? etc. 
 In such cases builder pattern comes to the rescue.
