## Real world example

Well look at Cars. There is one Prototype for a brand and rest a lot of copies, with some modifications are made. That is same here.

## In plain words

Create object based on an existing object through cloning.

The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

In short, it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it to your needs, instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from scratch and setting it up.
